### Hi there 👋

Here you can find several Opensource projects of mine. 

For example:
- if you want an online business card 📰 that is base64 encoded, you should take a look at [my-digital-card](https://github.com/weisser-dev/my-digital-card) ([Demo](https://weisser-dev.github.io/my-digital-card/)).
- ff you need a resume cv 📄 that looks nice on the web 📱 and also as a PDF or print version, then take a look here:  [responsive-resume-cv](https://github.com/weisser-dev/responsive-resume-cv-react) ([Demo](https://weisser-dev.github.io/responsive-resume-cv-react/))

I also have a few other projects 📚 and forks of projects that I find very exciting or, for example, are from my former trainees.
As you can see, I also have demos for most of my web projects that run directly in Github Pages. If you have any ideas or suggestions for improvement, feel free to get in touch, either via the respective project or alternatively on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-weisser/)

In case you're wondering why I often use animals 🐱 as images, for example? Well, the dogs (🐶 Balu and Luna) often sit in the office next to me and support me as a FeelGoodManager, so they should also find a place in the projects! :)
