### Hi there 👋

Here you can find several Opensource projects of mine. 

For example, if you want an online business card 📰 that is base64 encoded, you should take a look at https://github.com/weisser-dev/responsive-resume-cv-react.
If you need a resume cv 📄 that looks nice on the web 📱 and also as a PDF or print version, then take a look here: https://github.com/weisser-dev/responsive-resume-cv-react

I also have a few other projects 📚 and forks of projects that I find very exciting or, for example, are from my former trainees.

In case you're wondering why I often use animals 🐱 as images, for example? Well, the dogs (🐶 Balu and Luna) often sit in the office next to me and support me as a FeelGoodManager, so they should also find a place in the projects! :)
